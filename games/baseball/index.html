The <a href="basic.html">Basic Game</a> involves an accurate hitter
vs. pitchup matchup.  Each at-bat is resolved as a strikeout,
groundout, lineout, flyout, walk, single, double, triple or home run.
Even the basic game is played according to the 
<a href="http://www.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/baseball_basics/mlb_basics_foreward.jsp">
Official Rules of Baseball</a>.  Enough detail is generated from a game
for a box score.

<BR>
The <a href="advanced.html">Advanced Game</a> lets you add as much
detail as you want in whatever combination suits you.  The most basic
addition is fielding.  This naturally goes along with base running and
throwing.  You can add a number of strategic elements such as stealing
bases, the hit and run, sacrifice bunts and squeezes.  You can add
defensive positioning such as moving the infield in or holding
runners.  Pitcher fatigue for starters, long relievers and short
relievers can be added for a much more realistic pitching game.
Enough detail can be generated for

<FONT SIZE=+2 Color=red>How to Play</FONT>
<BR>
To play, you only need the player cards, dice, paper and pencil.  Each
outcome is determined by all players involved rolling 000-999 on three
ten-sided dice.  Higher rolls are always better.

If you're a student of the game, check out the
<a href="math.html">Mathematics</a> behind Little
Professor Baseball.  If you're not careful, you just
might learn a little bit about statistical estimation,
quadratic equations and why three ten-sided dice are
the way to roll.
