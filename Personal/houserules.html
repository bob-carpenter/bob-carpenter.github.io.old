<BR><b>THE FIRST THING I DO WHEN I WAKE IS</b> &nbsp 
turn on hot water for coffee.

<BR><b>I CAN'T GO TO SLEEP WITHOUT</b> &nbsp 
reading.

<BR><b>MY FAVORITE PORTRAIT OF MYSELF IS</b> &nbsp 
so old I look like a kid.

<BR><b>MY FAVORITE PHOTOGRAPH IS</b> &nbsp 
an old French street scene, preferably after dark.

<BR><b>THE PIECE OF ART I MOST COVET FOR MY OWN HOME IS</b> &nbsp 
anything from Mondrian's middle period.

<BR><b>MY REFIRGERATOR IS ALWAYS STOCKED WITH</b> &nbsp 
film.

<BR><b>I WATCH TELEVISON</b> &nbsp 
at Cedar, a bar around the corner, when there are big games on.

<BR><b>THE BEST VIEW IN MY HOUSE IS</b> &nbsp 
into the garden.

<BR><b>MY LIVING ROOM IS VACUUMED BY</b> &nbsp

<BR><b>MY DREAM HOUSE IS</b> &nbsp

<BR><b>A HOUSE IS NOT A HOME UNLESS</b> &nbsp
it's comfy, and that includes the basic functions: sleeping,
reading, and eating.
