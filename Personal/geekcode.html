GCS/CC/M/P/SS
Geek of Computer Science/Communications/Math/Philosophy/Social Science

d-(--)(+++) 
I'm usually in jeans and a t-shirt.
(My t-shirts go a step further and have a trendy political
message on them.)
(I tend to wear conservative dress such as a business suit or worse, 
a tie.)

s
I'm an average sized geek.

a35
I'm 35 years of age.

c++(-)
Computers are a large part of my existence.  When I get up
	in the morning, the first thing I do is log myself in.  I
	play games or mud on weekends, but still manage to stay
	off of academic probation.
(Anything more complicated than my calculator and I'm screwed.)

Ul
I have a unix (linux) account and use it to do my stuff in.

P+++(---)
Perl is a very powerful programming tool. Not only do I no
	longer write shell scripts,  I also no longer use awk or
	sed.  I use Perl for all programs of less than a thousand 
	lines.
(	Perl combines the power of sh, the clarity of sed, and the
	performance of awk with the simplicity of C.  It should be
	banned.)

J++++
I don't write Java, I speak it.  Java has superseded all
	other programming languages.  
L++
I use Linux ALMOST exclusively on my system.  I've given 
	up trying to achieve Linux.God status, but welcome the OS 
	as a replacement for DOS.  I only boot to DOS to play games.

E+
Emacs is great! I read my mail and news with it!

W++
	I have a homepage.  I surf daily.  My homepage is 
	advertised in my .signature.

N
Usenet News?  Sure, I read that once

O?
Usenet Oracle?

K?
Kibo

W
	Ok, so I use MS Windows, I don't have to like it.

O?
OS/2?

M
	I use a Mac, but I'm pretty indifferent about it.

V?
VMS?

PS++
I give to liberal causes.  I march for gay rights.  I'm a 
	card carrying member of the ACLU.  Keep abortion safe and 
	legal.  

PE
	Distrust both government and business.

Y+
I have an interest and concern in privacy issues, but in 
	reality I am not really all that active or vocal.

PGP-
	I don't have anything to hide.

t+ 
It's [Star Trek's] a damn fine TV show and is one of the only things
	good on television any more.

5-
	This show is sub-par.  The acting is wooden, the special
	effects are obviously poor quality.  In general, it seems
	like a very cheap Star Trek ripoff.

X
Ho hum.  Just another Fox show.

R+++
	I've written and published my own [role playing] gaming materials.

!tv
	I do not own a television.

b+++
I consume a few books a week as part of a staple diet.

DI++
I work with people that act a lot like Dilbert and his boss.

D
I've played the game and I'm pretty indifferent.

G
	I know what the geek code is and even did up this code.

e++++
	Managed to get my Ph.D.

h---
	Married, (persons living romantically with someone might as 
	well label themselves h---, you're as good as there already.)

r+++
	Found <a href="../../mitzi/index.html">someone</a>, dated, and am now married.

y+++
A male who has had sex.
	I'm married, so I can get it (theoretically) whenever I want.
