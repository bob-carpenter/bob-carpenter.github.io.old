  Bob's Dossier
</H1>


<p>The Dossier format is used by the <cite>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</cite> to interview well-known people around Pittsburgh, such as myself.

<p><b>Name:</b>
Robert Lee Carpenter

<p><b>Born:</b>
November 2, 1963; Detroit, Michigan, USA

<p><b>Accomplishment you're proudest of:</b>
Remaining open minded as I grow older.

<p><b>First job:</b>

I babysat, collected newspapers for recycling, delivered newspapers,
and sold an animatedk movie to TV before high school, but didn't have
a real job until I was 16.  I can't remember if it was being a little
league baseball umpire (damn those competitive parents), a cinema
usher (damn those drunk patrons and the movie <cite>Blues
Brothers</cite>, which I saw a gazillion times), or a silk screen
t-shirt re-toucher for the Athletic Supporter (I can still smell the
chemicals -- we did the bones, organs and tuxedo t-shirts -- look for
the logo in the lower left corner).

<p><b>Secret vice:</b>
The Science Show on Christian TV.  It's a gas.  Most of my real
vices are public.


<p><b>What three words describe you best:</b>
Mr. Bob Carpenter (do a web search and see)



<p><b>Dream vacation:</b>
Anywhere that's urban.  Paris, London, Amsterdam, New York, ...
I'm dying to go to India and the Far East -- I've only gotten as 
far East as Turkey and as far West as San Francisco.


<p><b>What you'd like to get around to doing one of these days:</b>
dunking a basketball


<p><b>Things you can do without:</b>
bureaucracy and rigid rules


<p><b>Things you can't do without:</b>
e-mail


<p><b>People you'd most like to have dinner with:</b>
Richard Feynman, Isaac Newton and Rene Descartes


<p><b>Movie you could see any time:</b>
<i>All that Jazz</i>  (I have other 
<A HREF="http://macduff.andrew.cmu.edu/carpenter/personal/films.html">
favorite movies</A>.)


<p><b>TV show you try not to miss:</b>
I'm trying to give up TV, really.  But the real answer is
<i>Star Trek</i> (followed closely by <i>Seinfeld</i> and <i>Dream On</i>)
Or any of the major sports finals, especially the NBA.


<p><b>Three things that can always be found in your refrigerator:</b>
(1) Indian Chili Garlic Paste (thanks to Mukesh Patel's mother, who
makes it in India),
(2) Coca-Cola and Peet's Coffee, (3) film


<p><b>Who would play you in the movies:</b>
Paul Newman somewhere between <i>The Hustler</i> and <i>The
Sting</i> days.   I'd take Cary Grant if Paul was busy.  
I imagine Denzel Washington would do a good job, too.

<p><b>Pittsburgh's best-kept secret:</b>
Candelight dinner's at our place.

<p><b>Your pet peeve about Pittsburgh:</b>
It's so provincial.

<p><b>People may be surprised to know that:</b>
I hate playing with computers. 

<p><b>What do you do on Saturday:</b>
sleep
