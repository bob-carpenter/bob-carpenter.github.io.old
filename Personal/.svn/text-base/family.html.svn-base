  Bob's Family
</H1>


<p> Bob's parents are in their late 50s.  Both grew up on the West Side
of Detroit.

<p> Bob's dad, <a href="../../mack/index.html">Mack Carpenter</a>, 
is a family practice lawyer in
independent practice in Redford Michigan.  Bob's dad likes to work out and has a 
waist the same size as Bob, but a chest 6 sizes larger!  Bob's paternal
grandparents, Lee Carpenter and Desta Carpenter, are still alive and
well and living in the West Side Detroit suburbs.  Lee was a mechanic,
plumber, electrician and machinist.  Desta was a baker and a card sharp.  They came
from Arkansas and Kentucky, respectively, moving to Detroit for jobs
during the auto boom.  

<p> Bob's mother, Carol Carpenter, has been a high school teacher, a
college teacher, a journalist, and is now a management consultant,
working mostly for Ford Motor Company.  Bob's mother likes to smoke
cigarettes and read mystery novels.  Bob's maternal grandfather,
Eugene Boggess, is still alive and well and living in the Western
Detroit suburbs.  He was a process engineer for a machine shop, and is
an avid gardener and traveler in his retirment.  He took the best
family photos I've ever seen on gorgeous Kodachromes over a span of
30 plus years.  Unfortunately, my
maternal grandmother, Ione Boggess, is no longer living.  Bob spent
lots of time with his grandmother when he was young, and was very
close to her.  She made the best peanut butter cookies ever.
But Ione's
father, Bob's great-grandfather on his mother's mother's side, Jack Simpson, is
amazingly still alive and pushing 102, and is living in Amsterdam, Ohio.
He was a farmer and a miner.

<p> Bob's sister, Cherie Carpenter, who is 6 years younger than Bob,
graduated from Wayne State Law School, and then promptly moved to
St. Louis with her husband, Leland, who is a pediatrician.  You can send Cherie email at
<a href="cherieSTL@aol.com">cherieSTL@aol.com</a> and
Leland email at <a href="mailto:PedIATRCN@aol.com">PedIATRCN@aol.com</a>.
Ask them about their dogs.  And their house.  

<p> <a href="../../mitzi/index.html">Bob's wife, Mitzi Morris</a>, gets her own page.  You'll have to ask her about our two cats.
