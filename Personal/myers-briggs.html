  Bob's Myers-Briggs Personality Type
</H1>

<P> The <a href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~pyeatt/myers-briggs.html">
Myers-Briggs Personality Typing</A>, based on Jung's theory of
psychologyical type, reports your preferences on 
<a href="http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~pyeatt/myers-briggs.html">four binary scales</a>
(yielding 16 types altogether).

<P>
I did my test the old fashioned way using the Myers-Briggs Type indicator Form G.  
You can classify yourself online using David Keirsey's
<A HREF="http://www.keirsey.com/cgi-bin/keirsey/newkts.cgi">
Temperament Sorter</A>.

<P>
I'm an <A HREF="entp.html">ENTP</A>, and a pretty extreme one:
<UL>
<LI> E: 21
<LI> N: 45
<LI> T: 39
<LI> P: 39
</UL>
<P>
About five percent of the general population are ENTPs.  I used to be
an even more extreme ENTP the last time I took the test when I was in
high school.  I learned about it from my mother's doctoral research in
writing; she was studying how different personality types, both
professional and amateur, approached the writing task.

<p> And despite my scepticism concerning most psychological testing,
this one's intentionally not trying to be too fine-grained, and is
pretty damn accurate.

<P>
The best site I've seen for the Myers-Briggs personality
typing is:
<UL>
<LI>
<a href="http://www.mbtypeguide.com/Type/">Myers-Briggs Personality Type on the Web</a>.  
</UL>
I was rather chuffed when they ran a profile of my site during May
1999, describing it thusly:

The home page is like an internet "business
card": it is a very sparse page with a photo, links to info on his
current job and company, and contact information.
