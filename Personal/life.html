    Bob's Life
</H1>


<p> Bob was born in Detroit on November 2, 1963.  Bob spent his early
childhood on the West Side of Detroit until age 10, where he attended
Detroit public schools.  By the time Bob moved out, his elementary
school (Pitcher Elementary) playground was barbed wired and all the
windows were barred and one of his friends was shot by an even younger
kid.  In elementary school, Bob spent all his time reading about
science and building model rockets and planes.

<p> Then Bob moved to the West side 'burb of Livonia, Michigan, where
he went to Whitman Junior High and Franklin High School (how
American).  In Junior High, Bob spent all of his time making Super 8mm
sci-fi and animated films with Dave Tucker and John Spanich, one of
which was sold to the TV show <cite>Kidsworld</cite> and can still be
caught in re-runs.

<p> In High School, Bob spent his time playing role playing games.  He
loved math and science, but found school awfully boring, so he tried
to get out of it as much as possible.  School activities worked well,
like student government, the tennis team, and various clubs.  

<p> Bob went to college at Michigan State University.  It's rather
difficult for a middle class kid in the US to afford to go to an
expensive private school like CMU -- it now costs over 100,000 US$ all
in, or about 60K more than a state school.  At MSU, Bob did math and
computer science, with lots of 20th century philosophy and psychology
on the side.  The good part about US universities is their flexible
undergrad curricula.
