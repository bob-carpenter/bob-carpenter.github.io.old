      <h1>Bob's Home Shop</h1>
      <p>
         
         Until this setup, I'd never built a computer.  The nearest I'd come
         was installing RAM or a graphics card under close supervision.  I was
         prompted to buy a new computer by the prices for memories and drives,
         the new intel bus, and the amazing new flat panel monitors.  With
         these components, I could build a great workstation for computational
         linguistics, a file server big enough to hold all of our CDs at full
         resolution, and a high quality home theater.  repository of my CD
         collection at full resolution.  But I couldn't find anyone selling it
         in the configuration I wanted.  I needed powerful and I wanted quiet.
         So what's a boy to do but build his own?
         
         <br>
         <br>
         Frankly, the hardest part of this whole process, now that it's
         over, was doing the research on the components to see what would
         fit together.  It'd be a lot quicker now after reading Mueller's
         book (see below) and having built two machines.  Here's the final
         system configurations.

                  I selected this case for a number of features, but most notably
                  the combination of quiet (through solid construction more than
                  anything else) and a high-quality, low-noise power supply.  I also
                  liked the fact that it was "piano black", which matches my
                  speakers, not to mention Mitzi's piano.  I think the "Antec"
                  spelled out on the side in holes is incredibly tacky, and defeats
                  the filter on the air intake on the front of the case, not to
                  mention allowing more air to escape and disrupting a pure low
                  front to high back ideal air flow for a case.  The silverish cover
                  for the front ports looks cheap compared to the rest of the case,
                  and I never even considered attaching the front LEDs.  Otherwise,
                  it's one of the nicest PC cases I've seen.  The paint job is
                  particularly impressive.  It was also pretty easy to work with,
                  though the front-to-back rather than conventional side-to-side
                  mounted drive bays meant my drives had to go in backwards in order
                  to fit the heads of the serial ATA cables.  When driven off the
                  mother-board's fan controller, the case fan's nearly silent. The
                  manual was quite helpful in laying out the steps to actually build
                  a computer.

                  This power supply is indeed quiet.  It also comes with more sockets than I needed,
                  for both this computer and Mitzi's.  The one fan seems to cool it adequately.
                  It gave off a bad odor when run in over the first couple of days.  Luckily, I'd seen
                  that reported elsewhere, or this having been my first project, I would've been very
                  worried.

                  Unlike the picture, the version I have does not have the north
                  bridge on a diagonal.  Lucky for me, because that means the Radeon
                  with the Zalman heat pipe fits with room to spare.  Note that this
                  "deluxe" version of the motherboard uses Intel's ICH5 rather than
                  ICH5R, the latter of which has the RAID controller.  Instead, it
                  employs Promise's 20378 RAID controller, which allows two serial ATA and
                  two ATA 133 disks to be configured in RAID 0, 1 or 0/1; I'm just
                  using two serial ATAs in RAID 0 (striping) for speed.  The board
                  also uses a 3COM 3C940 Gigabit LAN controller.  It also has an
                  Analog Devices AD1985 AC '97 CODEC (direct S/PDIF output) that
                  outputs an S/PDIF signal with SoundMAX 4XL software. It supports
                  two IEEE1394 sockets via a VIA 1394 controller, along with 8 USB 2.0
                  slots.  I like that it supports ECC RAM, whenever I can find some
                  for PC3200.  I like that it comes with WinDVD. Along with the
                  chassis's maual, the user's manual for this motherboard provided
                  the other half of the information needed to build a computer. It
                  also contained two serial ATA cables, two UltraDMA cables for the
                  optical drives, an IDE cable and a floppy cable.  So I returned
                  all the extra cables I'd bought; furthermore, the heads of the
                  rounded ATA cables were so bulky as to be harder to work with than
                  the ribbon cables. The InterVideo WinDVD suite is an excellent piece
                  of included software that I'm using to play DVD.

                  This processor's improved frontside bus and memory speed, coupled with the chipset's support
                  of RAID (despite using the Promise controller as noted above in this computer and the
                  3Ware Escalade in the other one)  was what led me down the path of getting a new machine.
                  I haven't really used anthing comparable, but I can attest that it's scary fast.

                  This memory seems to be loved by online reviewers, and ignored by Intel
                  and ASUS in their compatibility tests.  I simply couldn't find any of
                  the approved memory in large enough DIMMs and I wanted 2GB to train large
                  statistical models. Anyway, it seems to work just fine.  I did not pay the
                  premium for Corsair's matched pairs.  I'd love to get some ECC memory into
                  the picture, as I value reliability over speed.  And it may even be win-win,
                  because I've read ECC can be faster.  No problem with four of these making
                  2GB in Windows XP.

                  Ah, the Radeon 9700 Pro with 128MB and no whiny fan.  Graphics
                  bliss. The fans on my Oxygen card driving my SGI 1600SW at work
                  nearly drove me to distraction.  Despite the manual's statement
                  to the contrary, this card unequivocally drives
                  the monitor at 1920x1200 in both analog (VGA) and digital (DVI).
                  You need to install the drivers to get this to happen, and then
                  adjust through the advanced ATI menu if a frequency other than
                  60Hz is needed.  For some reason, I can only get this to 52Hz so
                  far, whereas the Radeon 9000 in Mitzi's machine has no problem at
                  60Hz.  I'm still waiting to evaluate its video capability with
                  DVDs; it's fine for the web and workstation apps.  DVI is way sharper
                  than analog.  There's simply no comparison. It had no
                  problem driving the monitor during BIOS setup from either the VGA
                  or DVI port.  This card works excellently with the games I've tried,
                  such as <a href="http://www.unrealtournament.com">Unreal Tournament</a> and 
                  <a href="www.neversoft.com/th3/">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3</a>.  Both games
                  only go up to 1280 width, and the card can easily handle the full
                  monty of resolution with resolution at max, anti-aliasing at max
                  and textures and effects at max.

                  These drives are incredibly fast at seeking, but even in RAID 0,
                  they can't quite pump data fast enough.  They're quieter than
                  I was expecting.  Inside the Sonata case, they're barely audible at
                  all, even when seeking.

                  Who'd have thought I'd have still needed a floppy?  I don't
                  use them.  But, it turns out I needed one in order to provide
                  Windows XP with a driver for the RAID controllers during the
                  Windows XP install from CD.  So, a floppy it is.  How retro.
                  I bought this one after reading the NewEgg reviews which said
                  it's the quietest -- I hate the grinding floppy noise.  I actually
                  built both machines with a temporary beige Mitsumi floppy, but
                  couldn't countenance one in my nice black case.  This one matches.

                  No problem installing this as a slave to the CD.  It even came
                  preset that way; I just had to be careful to get them in the case
                  in the right order.  The drive was recognized right away by the BIOS.
                  The quality of DVDs played through the graphics card is stunning.
                  It also provides digital output through the motherboard's onboard
                  digital processing, routing it to the main S/PDIF output from the motherboard.
                  The main problem is that it's loud when spinning a disk.  Closing the
                  bay door on the case muffles the noise considerably.

                  Ah, now we come to a major motivator for getting a new computer.
                  I started down the road toward the Apple HD Cineman Display, which
                  is a 23" monitor with the same resolution as this one.  But it only
                  had support for controls through Apple's specific hardware, and also
                  didn't have an S-video input.  While this monitor
                  doesn't take component video input, it's a whole lot cheaper than
                  the newer Samsung 241 MP monitors, which are 2000 dollars more
                  expensive for the same size and resolution (looks like the same
                  panel).  The display is just awesome, though the pixel pitch is
                  much wider than I'm used to from my 15 inch 1600x1200 notebook and
                  my 17" 1600x1024 SGI flat panel.  It works very nicely with
                  S-video input.  DVI images are much much sharper than the ones
                  driven from VGA. Despite the manual's claim that it won't run
                  1920x1200 in DVI, I had no problem driving it with my Radeon card.
                  With the VESA mounting option, I'd love to get one of those
                  articulated arms to mount this on the ceiling.  Especially if I could
                  find a retro machine-age dentist's light holder or something even
                  more steampunk in wrought iron.  Playing games and watching movies while
                  sitting close to this monitor is an almost <a href="http://www.imax.com">IMAX</a>-like immersion.

                  It feels much more solid than your typical mouse, and the tracking
                  is great.  Somewhat complex setup compared to other devices.  I
                  actually had to get out the manual to find the synch port on the mouse,

                  I paid my tax to Microsoft.  Luckily, there's a big reduction in cost if
                  you buy it with hardware as an OEM.  That means I'm my own support.  At least
                  I'm better than Microsoft.

      <h2>Mitzi's Workstation</h2>
      <p>
         This began life as the machine for holding the files.  In particular,
         there's enough disk space using RAID 5 to rip our entire CD collection
         (nearly 1000 CDs) at full resolution, as well as our CVS repositories.
         It'll be used to burn CVS backup CDs, and RAID 5 allows failover of
         one of the four disks.  Rather than getting state-of-the-art
         components like the workstation, I got the next step down in
         processor, graphics card, memory and disk drives.  I wanted roughly
         the same configuration because my time's almost as valuable as these
         components, and I didn't want to have to learn two motherboards, two
         different kinds of chip installations, or two different kinds of
         graphics cards.  Like my workstation, silence and inconspicuousness
         were design goals, so it motivated many of the same components anyway.
         The other obvious advantage of sharing motherboard and case with the
         workstation is that it'll be able to inherit hand-me-downs when the
         workstation is upgraded.  Which I just did.

                  When we upgraded this from a fileserver to a workstation, I swapped out the
                  old socket 478 chip at 533MHz frontside bus and replaced it with this
                  one, which is great value.  Really, this one's enough.  Rarely is the CPU
                  the bottleneck in the kind of statistical text processing that Mitzi and I do.

                  Two 256MBs seemed reasonable, and this stuff got good reviews and was
                  actually approved for the motherboard and the chipset.  I'd still like

                  Despite the contrary claim in the manul, like the 9700, this card
                  does indeed drive the monitor at 1920x1200 in DVI mode at 60Hz.
                  Quite the feat.  That's why I got 128MB memory for it.  Also note
                  that it has no fan, just a big heatsink (I don't know if that's
                  Sapphire's or ATI's work).  Compared to the 9700, it has half the
                  rendering channels, DirectX 8 vs. 9, and AGP 4X vs 8X.

                  The Tech Report did a very thorough RAID review, and this one had
                  the best performance for my usage pattern and peak requirements.
                  RAID 5 uses parity on one disk to give you number of disks - 1
                  times minimum disk capacity storage.  It also stripes the data,
                  including parity, so that reads are very very fast.  It's also the
                  fastest RAID to startup.  What's slow?  Writes are comparatively
                  slow.  The motherboard didn't provide quite enough RAID, so I
                  couldn't get the capacity due to requiring serial ATA (max 120 GB
                  available now, and expensive) and using 10 RAID (number of disks /
                  2 capacity).

                  These drives are both fast and quiet, being at the top of the
                  reviews in both categories (only the Barracudas in the workstation
                  tested quieter, but they weren't available in as large a size).
                  Now that we're down to a buck a gig, even with one drive being used
                  for parity, it'll only cost about 60 cents per CD.  In total, with
                  RAID 5, this provides 540GB of storage.

                  These two drives were first mounted in the workstation.  Then we
                  made the file server into a workstation, too, by inserting these
                  two drives to hold the OS and hooking up a monitor.  They're pretty
                  quiet, but not noticeably more so than the IBM drives, which test
                  faster and are 30 percent cheaper per gig.  To mount them in the
                  file server, I needed two brackets that would let me mount 3.5 inch
                  hard drives in the 5.25 inch external drive bays; they're not isolated
                  for sound, and in this configuration, are noticeably louder.

                  This is for one thing only -- exact audio copies.  And it works
                  way better than the Sony OEM of Lite-on I was using before it.  It's
                  a bit slow to load, but oh so smooth.

                  I got the first one of these as part of the Cordless Comfort Duo.
                  I couldn't adjust to the split keyboard, but loved the mouse.
                  It feels much more solid than your typical mouse, and the tracking
                  is great.  Somewhat complex setup compared to other devices.  I
                  actually had to get out the manual to find the synch port on the mouse,
                  which is microscopic translucent on translucent.

      <h2>Audio-Visual Clients</h2>
      <p>
         The internet audio client allows reading music data over the
         ethernet at full resolution and control via a web server which may
         be accessed by any browser on the network; the rest of the clients
         are more standard.  To the extent possible, audio signals remain
         full resolution digital until they hit the awesome Crystal DACs in
         the Harman Kardon receiver (same DACs as in the Lexicon MC 12,
         Lexicon being a sibling company of Harman Kardon).  The DVD player
         allows normal CD playing through a normal CD player.  The result of
         the cheap DVD player and great receiver leads to sound that's as
         good or perhaps even cleaner than the Linn Basik integrated CD/amp I
         was using before with the same speakers.

                  I knew this'd be poor quality compared to the computer due to the DVD player's
                  conversion to analog S-video and the monitor's then reconverting and upscaling it.
                  DVDs played on the computer through DVI output are much much sharper.
                  
                  <br> But I wanted an easy home-stereo-component-like way in
                  which to play a DVD or CD without a computer attached.  I had
                  plenty of digital sound inputs on the receiver.  Indeed, the
                  picture is far inferior on the monitor in S-video compared to
                  playing the DVD using WinDVD in the computer directly.  The
                  controls are very straightforward and CD-like, but it's a bit
                  slow in response, so you're never sure if the last command has
                  "taken", leading to double pressed ejects causing the carriage to
                  do a little cha-cha before returning to where it was.
                  
                  <br> I'm really waiting for an inexpensive DVD player with an
                  SDI output (digital HDTV), and then I'll hook up through the
                  Immersive Holo3DGraph scaler (see below).  But in the end, I
                  think I'll give this to my dad and get a very similar dual VHS
                  and DVD, so I can play legacy stuff.

                  This component is critical, as it handles all of the D/A in the
                  system by taking digital inputs from all of the components (other
                  than the VCR).  As such, I chose it for its Cirrus Logic
                  192KHz/24-bit DACs.I'm not exactly sure which 8-channel <a href="http://www.cirrus.com/en/products/pro/areas/PA12.html">Cirrus
                     DAC</a> Harman Kardon's using in the 325, but the only difference
                  between the two that match Harman Kardon's specs, 192KHz/24-bit,
                  namely the <a href="http://www.cirrus.com/en/products/pro/detail/P282.html">CS4382</a>
                  and the <a href="http://www.cirrus.com/en/products/pro/detail/P284.html">CS4383</a>,
                  is in how they handle mute.
                  
                  <br> This thing's a monster.  It's around 40-50 pounds, and it
                  generates a lot of heat, even in idle mode.  I don't actually need
                  all the surround modes, but I wanted the video switching and all
                  the inputs this machine had.  A terrible interface, this time
                  requiring not only the remote, but a TV just to set the front
                  speakers to "normal" mode (as opposed to "small" mode for limited
                  range speakers), and to tell it to read the CD player's digital
                  input; I realize this configuration is complex, but it doesn't
                  have to be this bad.  But, it sounds great, and has plenty of
                  power.  It's hideously ugly. Maybe I can hide it and control with
                  an IR remote receiver, which is possible through yet another set
                  of ports on the back.  Overall, this feels more like a VCR than a
                  high end stereo component, which is too bad from both an aesthetic
                  and usability standpoint.

                  I love monitor speakers for their clear midrange, and the PSBs are awesome.
                  I auditioned a lot of speakers a few years ago before deciding on these.
                  Nice finish that matches our piano (way nicer than the Antec cases).  
                  I don't have the stands, but they're not piano black and thus don't quite
                  match the finish of the speakers anyway.

                  and did not come with the cable.  I had plenty of decent RCA cables lying
                  around from my analog audio days to use as S/PDIF coax connectors.  Oddly
                  enough, at Radio Shack, the 12 foot model was 10 bucks, whereas the
                  6 foot model in the newer box was 20 bucks.  Have these things gone up
                  tremendously in price?

                  I was taken aback by the quality of the material written on hardware.
                  This book contains anything you'll need to know to build a computer
                  with parts available as of midyear 2003.  It also contains
                  everything you need to know about how those parts work, down to
                  which materials are dug out of the ground and refined to make them.
                  <br>
                  What really surprised me is that between the two of them, the case and
                  motherboard manuals would've almost been enough information to put
                  the whole computer together.  The only exception was Windows,
                  which had a tricky installation step where the RAID drives had to
                  be written to a floppy in order to load during the installationof
                  Windows XP.

         Here are items I'm considering getting, but haven't purchased yet.
         The subwoofer and PS2 are at the front of the line.  Any suggestions

                  I'd own this component if I could justify a DVD player with SDI outputs.
                  But they just don't make them, and tweaking a high-end DVD player costs
                  600 bucks.  I'll cross my fingers that they're coming soon.

                  This got great reviews, and the Harman Kardon pumps out the cleanest
                  bass I've ever heard, judging from how they power my monitor speakers.

                  A timbral match for my PSB monitor speakers, but I'm just not sure
                  it's necessary; the sound stage is just fine with the stereo.  Finding
                  a place to put them would be very tricky as I'm using a desktop monitor
                  for my screen.

                  These don't quite match the front speakers, but it'd be hard to justify
                  spending another grand on surrounds.  Plus, for 7.1, I'd need two of
                  them.  I just don't think our apartment's big enough without
                  some serious ceiling-level installation.

                  I'm waiting to see if they release a new one this summer.  There's
                  an announcement out already.  If I hadn't seen that, I'd have 
                  probably already bought one.  It doesn't come with a remote or
                  a second controller.  I'll probably get the wireless controllers
                  from Logitech anyway.
