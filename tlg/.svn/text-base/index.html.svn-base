<H2>The Theorem Prover</H2>

<P>
This site is devoted to the:
<UL>
<LI><a href="parser.html"><b>Type-Logical Grammar Theorem Prover</b></a>.  
</UL>

<P>
This theorem prover provides a parser for type-logical grammar,
a variety of
<a href ="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/ai/CG/">categorial grammar</a>.

<H2>Technical Background</H2>

<P>
The Prolog parser is based on a bottom-up chart parser for phrase
structure grammars.   Empty categories are handled as usual, and
hypotheticals are assumed where specified in the input, and then
discharged by a Cooper-storage-like mechanism.  Each rule checks that
the tree that it has created is normal.  The terms are displayed in
beta-eta-normal form.  You can check out:

There is a separate document explaining the:

<H2>History</H2>

<P>
This theorem prover was used to generate the examples in 
<a href="../carp/index.html">Bob Carpenter</a>'s book, 
<a href="../carp/books/tls/index.html">Type-Logical Semantics</a> 
(1998, MIT Press).

<P>
In early 2000, the web server at CMU with my CGI was
retired after about five years of continuous service.

<P>
In October 2000, Geert Kloosterman, of the University
of Groningen in the Netherlands, reimplimented the CGI
handler on their local server, which is where results
are currently being served from.
