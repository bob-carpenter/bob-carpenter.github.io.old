<H3>Resizing Windows</H3>
<P>
The Query window, the lexicon window, and the output display windows
can be resized, but not repositioned.  To resize them, simply position
the cursor on their border and click to grab and drag.

<h3>Options Dialogue</h3>
<P>
Clicking on the <b>Options</b> button summons a dialogue box which can
be used to select various options relating to the input and output of
the system.


<H2><A NAME="Lexicon">The Lexicon Window</A>
<A href="#Directory"><FONT SIZE=-0>[back to Directory]</FONT></A> 
</H2>
<P>
The complete list of words recognized by the parser can be browsed by
scrolling in the Lexicon window.  The white space between entries is
an artificat of Netscape's windowing (as of version 2.0b6a).  

<H2><A NAME="Saving">Saving Results</A>
<A href="#Directory"><FONT SIZE=-0>[back to Directory]</FONT></A> 
</H2>
<P>
Results of any analysis can be saved by selecting the 'Save As' or
'Save Frame As' options, depending on whether or not you are using the
frame-based browser.  As of Netscape 2.0b6a, the frame currently
selected is outlined in black.  The results will be saved as an
HTML-formatted document. 

<H2><A NAME="Options">Customizing the Environment</A>
<A href="#Directory"><FONT SIZE=-0>[back to Directory]</FONT></A> 
</H2>
<P>
The user can reconfigure the parser's style and look by clicking on
the Options button and making selections from the window that is
subsequently brought up.  The current options are:
<DL>
<DT> Output Style
<DD> 
Allows the user to select the form of output.  Options available are:
  <UL>
  <LI> Prawitz
  <LI> Fitch
  <LI> Text 
  </UL>

Prawitz is the standard notation for natural deduction proofs in tree
format.  

Text style approximates the Prawitz style using indentation
rather than HTML tables.

Fitch style presents proofs in a column, with one step per
row.  In this format, we indicate the string associated with each
step. 

<BR><BR>
<DT>Output Target
<DD>

The user may select to have output displayed in the output frame of
the primary parser window, in a new window for each parse, or in a
single external window, depending on the choice of:
  <UL>
  <LI> Local Frame
  <LI> New Window
  <LI> Single External Window
  </UL> 

<BR>
<DT> Parse as
<DD>
Allows the user to select which category the input string should be
parsed as.  Options available are:
  <UL>
  <LI> Any
  <LI> Finite S
  <LI> Noun Phrase
  </UL>


<BR>
<DT> Expand Meanings
<DD>
Choosing Yes or No determines whether or not the meaning postulates
associated with non-logical constants are expanded.  

<BR><BR>
<DT> Normalize Lambda Terms
<DD> 
Choosing Yes or No determines whether or not the lambda terms involved
in meanings are converted to beta-eta normal form or whether they are
left unreduced.   

</DL>
<P>
Clicking on the OK button submits the options selected and returns the
user to the query frame.  The Defaults button reverts all selections
to their default values.

<H2><A NAME="Optimization">Getting the Most out of the Parser</A>
<A href="#Directory"><FONT SIZE=-0>[back to Directory]</FONT></A> 
</H2>
<P>
The operating system under which the server is operating (the Andrew
File System at CMU) is set up to cache programs that have been
recently run.  As a result, the first call to the parser may be much
slower than subsequent calls because of the need for my local machine
to fetch a copy of SICStus Prolog to local memory.  

<P>
For those with small monitors, it may help to pull down the Options
menu and hide all of the buttons, captions, sites, and other clutter
that occupies the top portion of most browsers.
