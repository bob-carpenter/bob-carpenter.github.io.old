<H1>VoiceXML Sites on Colloquial</H1>

<P>
VoiceXML is a new technology that enables you to write voice
dialogues in much the same way as you write HTML.  
You can find the spec and further information at
<a href="http://www.voicexml.org">The VoiceXML Forum</a>.

<P>
<a href="http://www.colloquial.com">Colloquial</a> has decided to concentrate its energies on
games rather than commerce.

<P>
Currently, <a href="http://www.tellme.com">TellMe</a> is
hosting VoiceXML applications through 
<a href="http://studio.tellme.com">TellMe Studio</a>.

<P>
They provide a VoiceXML client and a telephony
server that is reachable by toll-free number.
The interface and language understanding are hosted
by <a href="http://www.colloquial.com/">colloquial</a>.
