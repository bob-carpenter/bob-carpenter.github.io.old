<b>SpeechSmuggler</b> is the exciting game of inter-borough trading.
You're an aspiring merchant with a few bucks and an even larger
debt.  You jet from borough to borough buying and selling your
wares.  You can see the sights.  You can try to avoid Officer
HardAss or buy a gun and get into a shootout.

a long history.
